## Full-Stack Quality Engineer | Backend Developer - QA Specialist

I'm a Backend Developer and QA Engineer with a unique background: **15 years in the film industry** as an award-winning sound designer before transitioning to tech in 2020. This journey taught me that **quality isn't just about testing - it's about understanding how things are built from the ground up**.

My experience leading cross-functional teams in high-pressure film production environments translates directly into software: **attention to detail, collaborative problem-solving, and delivering precise results under tight deadlines**.

---

## What Makes Me Different

**From Cinema to Code:** My background in immersive audio (cinema, VR, games, spatial sound) gave me a perfectionist's eye for detail and a deep understanding of **user experience from every angle** - skills that translate perfectly into quality engineering.

**QA Before I Knew It:** In 2016, I worked as **Post-Production Coordinator at Festival do Rio** (Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival), where I performed **QA validation on digital film deliverables** - verifying codecs, audio sync, subtitles, and packaging formats (DCP). I designed testing checklists, detected media inconsistencies, and troubleshot audiovisual failures under tight festival deadlines. **I was doing quality assurance before I even knew what QA Engineering was!**

**Full-Cycle Perspective:** I don't just test software - I understand how it's built. With 4+ years of backend development and QA experience, I can:
- Identify potential issues early in the development cycle
- Write better automation frameworks that mirror real-world architecture
- Communicate effectively with developers (I've been one!)

**Trilingual Communicator:** Native-level fluency in Portuguese and English. Advanced fluency in Spanish. Comfortable working with international, distributed teams.

## Featured Project

### [Selenium Test Automation Framework](https://github.com/mtiengo/selenium-test-automation-framework) *Work in Progress*

A modern, scalable test automation framework built with:
- **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture with instance-based design (parallel-test ready)
- **Facade Pattern** for clean, maintainable code
- Java 21 + Selenium 4 + TestNG
- Multi-browser support via WebDriverManager
- Built-in screenshot capture on test failures

*Currently expanding test coverage and adding CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions.*
